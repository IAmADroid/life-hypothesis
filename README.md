# What is the "life-hypothesis"?
We all know that there is no book that tells you how to live life, 
like how to manage relationships and marriage, 
how to find a good career, how to be a good friend.

We also know that these decisions are extremely important in our lives, that we need to be
careful with these things, and that we should consult wise people for these difficult decisions.

But where are the wise people going to get their information from? They're not really any smarter
than we are, we just hope they have more experience with the topic. Maybe we consult someone a few
decades older than us for their wisdom. But I find that "adults" are quite often just as immature
as the rest of us, just with more memories. And I find it best when the adults share their stories
rather than their opinions, so I can get past the inherent biases humans have with personal
experience.

So far, the de-facto source of morality and life decision has been religion. If you want to put
your life together, make a better person out of yourself, go to a church/synagogue/mosque/monastery.
Take classes with your pastor/priest/father/rabbi/imam/abbot/bhikku and figure out those
difficult life decisions with them.

But again, religion runs into the same issues that we do, where the pastor doesn't seem all that
different than us, and we have to worry if our pastor is bigoted or fascist or simply a decent person.
Not all religious leaders take the job seriously. Some religions treat it like a proper job, and require
you to have four years experience in theology or a bachelors in philosophy. But I've seen plenty
of religious leaders that have no academic background, that simply had decent enough charisma
to hold religious services, that never took it seriously, that simply see this as an easy way to
earn money off the contributing members of the community who don't know what a well studied
academic theologist should look like.

I'll be upfront that I'm a convert to judaism, and all the Rebeh's at the conservative synagogue
have to have formal training at a rabbinical school. And the Rabbi doesn't own the synagogue!
A synagogue has a separate president and board that runs the business side of the synagogue,
like membership and fees and events and planning. In fact, a synagogue can go without a Rabbi
at all! which is obsurd! usually the pastor or the pastor's family owns the church, so the
idea of not having a religious leader feels insane! but it's not! Jewish services are often
a very strict routine, with the torah readings and songs all on a 3 year schedule. (We go through
the same torah every year, but we switch focus between the beginning, middle, and end of a parashah)

So you don't need a Rabbi who gives sermons at all in a Jewish synagogue. All you really need is
a cantor (the singer) to lead you through your regularly scheduled prayers in your siddur (a book
that has all the prayers). And you can sometimes get rid of the Cantor too! if you have a 
quorum of 10 jews (called a minyan), then you can do special prayers that are best done
in a community.

I quite appreciate the American conservative synagogue. An orthodox tries to live as 
traditionally as possible, making sure that the same faith survives thousands of years,
but the conservative tries to see how to interpret the laws for our modern times.
There are also ... sorry I'm going off on a tagent.

The point is, the American Conservative Jewish synagogue is so far one of the safest religious
sanctuaries I've seen in terms of political structure and constitution. It doesn't let
one person get too much control where they can control an entire community at their whim
and get power crazy, it has interviews and democratic elections for choosing
the next Rabbi, the board vets candidates to make sure they have the proper academic
credentials to be qualified as a Rabbi. The board makes sure we have several options to 
choose from, hires a temporary rabbi to lead service while we look for a permanent one,
and sets up the election processes. As a reliability engineer, I quite admire the thought
into the logistics in how a "religious leader" gets chosen, and the quality control to
make sure we don't get just any Joe Shmoe.

And if you thought formal process for choosing religious leaders was strange, you actually
have to be certified to become Jewish! Normally after your Bar/Bat Mitzvah (After you complete
conversion classes and conversion process for a convert) you recieve a certificate from
your synagogue vouching for you as a member! and this certificate has real implications!
it determines your eligibility to get sponsorships for birthright trips, and it helps
you get accepted into other synagogues. It's kinda crazy to think you can be certified
as a religious person, but you totally can!

Anyways, in comparison to the modern majority religions in the United States, it seems the
orthodox have this down to a science.

So why not make this an actual science? One with Hypothesis and experiments and proof and
disproof? Specifically on the moral decisions/philosophy. The validity of historic miracles
can not be proven or disproven until someone invents a time machine, so let's not waste
time arguing over the truthfullness of a particular story. I just want experimental 
evidence on the moral conclusions we make based on our culture, an agnostic approach to
morality than can be universally appreciated.

So let's revisit one of those early points I made: "there is no book that tells you how to live life"
But why can't there be a book? The book may not exist right now, but why can't we make one?
Now some will argue that their holy text is the book that tells you how to live life, but I disagree.
In science, what makes it special is that you can show it to be true via experiment. The theories
are falsifiable. The problem with holy texts is that they often lack the ability to be proven wrong,
they are true just because they are true, or because god said so, not because we actually 
did an experiment and the statistics suggested this model of thinking.

And even if a holy book did make falsifiable claims, holy books often have historical significance,
and cannot be modified. That is not good when you want to have a highly accurate textbook.
Of couse in conservative judaism we have an actual textbook we study (other than the torah, 
it's called "On One Foot".) in order 
to practice conservative judaism.

But I argue that this isn't the book either. the On One Foot textbook talks a lot about
the history and traditions of the religion. History and traditions aren't falsifiable
like a physics theory is falsifiable. History and traditions are the way they are just
because they are.

Although plenty of books make claim to guide our motal soul, I want a scientifically rigorous
source of morality. Theories which can be proven wrong. Theories we can experiment on and test.
Theories that can make it into a peer-reviewed journal on Human behaviour and effective
management.


I think the reason we can't make a book is because there simply isn't enough scientific research 
to answer all the moral questions we have. Or even if we have the research, it hasn't been made
centralized enough into a coherent scientific theory of morality.

So why don't we have a centralized source of morality? I think it's because no one has properly
done step 1 of the scientific method: Hypothesis.
Religion stops challengers in their tracks by telling you that it can't be proven wrong. But
if we had a real, scientific, falsifiable set of theory on morality, then we could turn the the
discussion from "Who's unprovable theory of the afterlife has the most anecdotal evidence" to
"How can I conduct experiments to verify or disprove this theory?"
I think a scientific approach to morality is what the world needs to push the frontier of
humanity. A place where reliable experiment can be found.

I don't think morality is inherintly tied to the faiths (which by definition faith is not provable,
you just trust that it's true). I think morality can be a science.
I guess that you could say I have faith that morality can be scientific. lol.

So anyway, Step 1: Hypothesis, that's what this book is. This book will come up
with all the theories. Probably a lot of wrong theories, but it will be proven wrong. and
it will be improved. (Honestly don't trust this book until it's gotten to like the 50th edition;
right now it's a 0th edition ramble by some kid who thinks he knows everything)

So I'll start this off with the [topic list](topics.md) so we can have a theory to prove wrong.
(There's going to be a lot of wrong stuff in this hypothesis book, so please don't hate me!
I'm only one guy, I need as much support as I can get to improve the accuracy of this book.
Forks are encouraged!)
